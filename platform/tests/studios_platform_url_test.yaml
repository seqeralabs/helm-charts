suite: test Studios platform URL configuration from platform chart
templates:
  - charts/studios/templates/configmap.yaml
chart:
  version: 1.2.3
  appVersion: "v9.9.9"
release:
  name: release-name
tests:
  - it: should render the configmaps when studios is enabled

    set:
      studios:
        enabled: true
      # When deploying studios as part of platform, provide the explicit backend service name
      # rather than a template, as templates are evaluated in the studios subchart context

    set:
      studios:
        enabled: true
      # Note: Templates in global.platformServiceAddress are evaluated in the studios subchart context,
